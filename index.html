         Sea Bubbles Hawaii has trips for all experience levels, from first time beginner divers through advanced divers, divemasters, and instructors.  Every day, we see spectacular colorful reefs, amazing shipwrecks; these dive sites are home to sea turtles, corals, and reef fish like the famous state fish: humu humu nuku nuku apua’a.  If we are lucky, a dolphin, ray, or even a whale will swim by! Kilikina, our custom built dive boat, runs on locally sourced 100% bio-diesel, we are the only GREEN boat on Oahu.  We love the ocean and nature, it is our responsibility to minimize our impact and care of the environment. That is also why we only take small groups diving. We choose to limit the number of people on our boat in order to have the smallest impact on the reefs. Scuba is our passion at Hawaiian Diving Adventures. Many of our crew can be found on their days off in the water exploring new dive sites.  We have developed many new dive sites minimizing the impact on any one reef and giving us the chance to show you something new.

        Have fun swimming around and exploring while putting those key skills to use with an instructor on a shallow reef dive.   While not a scuba certification course, Discover Scuba Diving is a quick and easy introduction to what it takes to explore the underwater world.
